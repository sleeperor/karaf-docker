karaf-docker
============

First attempt to run [apache-karaf](http://karaf.apache.org) inside [docker](http://docker.io) container.
Is is based on [fabric8-docker](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-docker), but the idea is to provide generic karaf container support.

Build

Simply run build.sh script.
